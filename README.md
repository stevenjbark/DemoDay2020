# Description
Federally-funded local community and regional healthcare clinics are critical infrastructure for the healthcare of
millions of Americans. As the COVID-19 Pandemic has revealed, these clinics have not been maintained at the appropriate
level of effectiveness or funding. This project evaluated local community and regional healthcare clinics, geographical
locations, health metrics at the county and state level, and employed machine learning algorithms to calculate clinic
types and important health metrics.
