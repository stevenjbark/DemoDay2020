Clinics in Crisis: COVID-19 Dashboard

DESCRIPTION:
The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has demonstrated severe limitations in healthcare infrastructure in the United States. In many regions of the country, the primary mechanism for health care delivery are the local and regional health care clinics. We have evaluated the distribution and concepts used for federally-funded health care clinics in counties from all 50 states. Included in these evaluations maps and data tables, multiple pages for state and county data, machine learning approaches for estimating important parameters for health clinic performances, and a COVID-19 dashboard to relate outbreak information at the state and county level.

TOOLS USED:

JavaScript
Tableau
Flask (Construction of API, Data Repository, and User-Interactive Data Input System)
